Final project for General Assembly Back End Web Development Course

A brief example of how to create:

1) A home page

2) A private products catalog

3) A shopping cart

4) An admin page only accessible for administrators

Note: This is not a working application with stripe. Orders would be placed and fulfilled on the back end through admin only, as in wholesale/screen printer type transactions.
